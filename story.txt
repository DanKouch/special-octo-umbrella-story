It was a cold, dark, and stormy winter night in rural northern Nevada. Chris the frog sat underneath a rotting log at the edge of an open grassy plain. He stared longingly at the brightly lit structure that sat in its center, unaware of his impending demise.
the trees were buried in snow
There was a light in the distance closing in. It was coming fast and Chris could only do one thing. Wait for it.
The truck barely shook as it tore through the rotted fallen tree on the highway.
Chris waited and waited. It took nearly 2 weeks for the light.
Winter was coming to an end.
